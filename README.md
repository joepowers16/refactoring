I began this repo to experiment with refactoring my code. I was particularly keen to experiment with renaming. Often the purpose of functions and  intermediate datasets will evolve and I will want to update the their namea to reflect this clarified purpose. 

The major refactorings ocurred with munge/rename_files.R and Shift + Cmd + F in Sublime Text Editor.
